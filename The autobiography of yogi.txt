This astonishing autobiography details the life of a man who knew from childhood he would travel a mystic path, and would follow his dreams to be a devotee of God and an exemplary yogi. Paramahansa Yogananda, known in childhood as Mukunda Groh, was an adventurous, spirited boy. His family was of an upper caste in India, his father a railroad executive and fairly well-to-do. Young Mukunda seems to have full and clear recall of events and conversations of his childhood, particularly those that reveal the supernatural and at times, awesome experiences he has as a budding enlightened being. Young Mukunda, although mischievous, is extremely honest and maintains the highest level of integrity, especially for a child. He seems to have been born with a set of spiritual values that were reinforced by his parents, who were devotees of Lahiri Mahasaya, a celebrated saint and prophet.
